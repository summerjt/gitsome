		<p>Before I met you, I was wasting my time. Finding the right files was such a drag, I had to drop it once I met you. You talk to the kernel for me, a guy whos serious and powerful. If I'm lost I can always call my man: to explain things to me. You help me change (cd) when I need something different.</p>

		<p>Show me what you've got (ls) <br> No I want everything (ls-la)  I'll never forget how you rescued me from the virtual maching and let me take control of my own compiling. (g++ -std=c++11) and let me run (./) when I am done</p>
